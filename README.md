# Word-Sense-Disambiguation-by-learning-long-term-dependencies
Word sense disambiguation by using recurrent networks like Bidirectional LSTM
Attribution

Datasets used for experiments were from senseval2 competition http://www.senseval.org/data.html
I used glove vectors for intializing word vectors https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
Thanks to Dominik inikdom for uploading his code for neural-sentiment https://github.com/inikdom/neural-sentiment  which I modifed for my Word-Sense-Disambiguation task.
